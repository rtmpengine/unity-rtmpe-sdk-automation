// RTMPE SDK — Editor/BuildApiKeyEnvelopeValidator.cs
//
// Build-time guard: a Player build must ship an API-key envelope (a sealed-box
// server public key or a PSK) in a NetworkSettings asset, because outside the
// Unity Editor the runtime refuses to send the API key unencrypted.  Without
// one, every connection fails at the handshake with a Timeout that is only
// diagnosable after the binary is distributed.  Failing the build here turns
// that late, opaque failure into an immediate, named one.
//
// Scope: a lightweight project-level check (no scene loading).  Three outcomes:
//   * one or more assets exist but NOT ONE carries an envelope -> fail the build
//     (the unambiguous "an asset was authored yet left blank" case);
//   * some assets carry an envelope and some are blank -> warn (this check
//     cannot tell which asset the NetworkManager in the built scenes references,
//     so blocking could be a false positive, yet a blank wired asset would still
//     fail at connect time — so surface it without blocking);
//   * no NetworkSettings asset exists at all -> warn, because a project may
//     legitimately construct NetworkSettings at runtime and ship no asset.
// The complementary runtime warning (NetworkManager.Awake, unbound Settings
// field) and the connect-time diagnostic (a wired-but-empty asset) cover the
// finer cases.  The whole body is guarded so a fault in the validator itself
// degrades to a warning and can never block a legitimate build; only the
// intended, explained failure throws.
