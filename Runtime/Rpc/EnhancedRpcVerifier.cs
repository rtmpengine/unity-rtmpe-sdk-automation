// AEAD authenticates the gateway as the relay, NOT the originating peer.
// A malicious peer in the same room can craft any senderId/objectId/target
// it likes; the gateway only attests "I delivered this payload to you", not
// "this payload was honestly authored".  Treat every wire-derived field as
// hostile until verified.
//
// Extension hooks:
//  • SenderVerifier  — integrators set this delegate to gate inbound
//                      senderId values against their own room/session
//                      roster.  Default: self-only — DefaultSenderVerifier
//                      admits ONLY the local session id (the gateway's
//                      echo of the client's own RPCs); peers must be opted
//                      in explicitly, because AEAD authenticates the
//                      gateway as relay, not the originating peer.
//  • ObjectExistsVerifier — optional sanity hook.  NetworkManager
//                      already gates dispatch on the spawn registry,
//                      so the default returns true (no extra check
//                      beyond the registry lookup the dispatch path
//                      already performs).  Provided so security-
//                      sensitive games can layer additional checks
//                      (e.g. "is this object in the sender's interest
//                      set?") without monkey-patching NetworkManager.
//
// The verifier is intentionally a static, allocation-free policy object.
// Inbound RPC dispatch is on the hot path and must not allocate per
// packet.
