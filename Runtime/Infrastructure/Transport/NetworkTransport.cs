// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Infrastructure/Transport/NetworkTransport.cs
//
// Abstract base for all network transports.
// The concrete transport shipped with this package is UdpTransport.  KCP,
// WebSocket, and WebGL transports are integrator-supplied and registered
// through NetworkManager.SetTransportFactory.
//
// All methods are invoked from the RTMPE background network thread and must
// be internally thread-safe. Do NOT call Unity APIs from implementations.
