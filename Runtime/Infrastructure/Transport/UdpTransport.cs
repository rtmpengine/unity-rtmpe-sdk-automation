// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Infrastructure/Transport/UdpTransport.cs
//
// Non-blocking UDP socket transport.
//
// Design notes:
// • Blocking = false + Poll(0) avoids any blocking system call on the hot path.
// • SendTo / ReceiveFrom are used (not Connect+Send/Receive) to avoid the implicit
//   UDP "connection" state that can trigger ICMP port-unreachable errors on some OSes.
// • SocketError.WouldBlock / ConnectionReset are silently swallowed per RFC 1122;
//   the receive loop simply returns 0 bytes and retries next iteration.
// • An IDisposable _disposed guard prevents double-dispose races on shutdown.
//
// Concurrency model:
//  The socket lifetime is racy by design: Disconnect() may be called from any
//  thread (typically the main thread on shutdown) while the network background
//  thread is parked inside Poll() or ReceiveFrom().  Rather than serialise the
//  hot syscall paths under a lock — which would defeat the non-blocking design
//  and risk deadlocks if Dispose() ran on the same thread that holds the lock —
//  we treat disposal as racing with the next syscall and tolerate it:
//
//    1. _socket is read into a local variable once per call ("snapshot").  Any
//       subsequent Disconnect() that nulls the field cannot turn the local
//       reference into null mid-syscall, so the NullReferenceException class
//       of bug is eliminated.
//    2. ObjectDisposedException and the "racing close" SocketError variants are
//       caught and converted into a benign return (false / 0).  The caller
//       loop checks _running on the next iteration and exits cleanly.
//
// This is the conventional .NET idiom for closing a socket from a thread other
// than the one parked in the syscall — the same pattern used by Kestrel,
// SignalR and the BCL's own SocketAsyncEventArgs reference implementations.
