// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Infrastructure/Threading/ThreadSafeQueue.cs
//
// Lock-free FIFO queue for cross-thread producer/consumer scenarios.
//
// Why ConcurrentQueue<T> instead of Queue<T> + lock?
//  ConcurrentQueue uses CAS (compare-and-swap) internally — no OS mutex is
//  acquired on the hot path. On .NET Standard 2.1 / Unity IL2CPP this eliminates
//  lock contention and priority inversion between the network background thread
//  and the Unity main thread, which is critical for sub-30 ms P99 latency.
//
// .NET Standard 2.1 note:
//  ConcurrentQueue<T>.Clear() was added in .NET 5 and is NOT available on
//  .NET Standard 2.1 / Unity IL2CPP. Use the drain-loop pattern (see Clear()).
