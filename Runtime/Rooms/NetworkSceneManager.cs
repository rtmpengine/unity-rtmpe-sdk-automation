// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Rooms/NetworkSceneManager.cs
//
// High-level scene-synchronisation façade that piggybacks on the Custom
// Properties channel introduced in Phase 1.  The authoritative scene name
// lives in the room's `custom_properties["__scene"]` reserved key; the host
// drives changes via RoomPropertyUpdate (0x24) and every other client
// receives the change as a normal property-update broadcast — which gives
// late-joiners free synchronisation for no extra migration cost.
//
// Scene-load readiness is reported separately via the SceneLoaded (0x2F)
// packet.  The Room Service aggregates reports and emits
// `all_players_scene_loaded` once the last player is ready; the SDK
// surfaces that as OnAllPlayersSceneLoaded.
