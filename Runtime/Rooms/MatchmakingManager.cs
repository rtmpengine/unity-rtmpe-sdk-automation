// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Rooms/MatchmakingManager.cs
//
// High-level AutoJoinOrCreate API.
// Created by NetworkManager and receives MatchmakingResponse (0x2B) callbacks.
//
// Threading model:
//   • All public methods MUST be called from the Unity main thread.
//   • HandleMatchmakingResponse() is called from NetworkManager.ProcessPacket()
//     which runs on the main thread (via MainThreadDispatcher).
//   • Tick(double) MUST be called from the Unity main thread (typically
//     NetworkManager.Update()).  If never called, timeout enforcement is
//     simply disabled — Cancel and once-only-delivery gates still work.
//
// Reliability guarantees:
//   • Once-only callback delivery — exactly one of OnMatchmakingComplete /
//     OnMatchmakingFailed / OnMatchmakingCancelled / OnMatchmakingTimedOut
//     fires per StartMatchmaking call, even if the server retries the
//     response or the client cancels mid-flight.
//   • Cancel — CancelFindMatch() drops any in-flight request silently;
//     subsequent server responses for that request are discarded.  Fires
//     OnMatchmakingCancelled exactly once.
//   • Timeout — when configured, fires OnMatchmakingTimedOut and latches
//     the request so a late server response is ignored.
