// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Rooms/InterestManager.cs
//
// Feature #6: Interest Management — client-side position reporting.
//
// InterestManager is a MonoBehaviour that periodically sends the local player's
// 2-D world position to the gateway via PositionUpdate (0x42) packets.  The
// gateway uses the position to apply spatial-grid culling so that room-wide
// broadcasts from the Sync Engine only reach clients whose 3×3 cell
// neighbourhood (default: 150 m × 150 m with a 50 m cell size) overlaps the
// source position embedded in the broadcast.
//
// Clients that never attach InterestManager (or that call StopTracking())
// receive every room-wide broadcast unchanged — opt-in semantics preserve
// full backwards compatibility.
//
// Usage:
//   Add InterestManager to the local player's GameObject, or to any persistent
//   manager object, and assign the tracked Transform.  The component sends
//   positions automatically while the player is in a room.
//
// Protocol:
//   Packet 0x42 payload — [x: f32 LE][y: f32 LE] (8 bytes)
//   The x/y values are the tracked transform's world position projected onto
//   the XZ plane (Y is vertical in Unity 3D games; for 2-D games, use Y).
//
// Gateway counterpart:
//   modules/gateway/src/interest/spatial_grid.rs
//   modules/gateway/src/session/store.rs  (AppSession.position)
//   modules/gateway/src/nats/broadcast.rs (zone-filtered dispatch)
