// In-flight CreateRoom request bookkeeping for RoomManager.  Carved out of
// RoomManager into its own type so the correlator's invariants (id-based
// matching with FIFO fallback, capacity cap, TTL-bounded growth) can be
// unit-tested without spinning up the full RoomManager surface (which
// depends on UnityEngine, PacketBuilder, RoomPacketBuilder, ...).
//
// Threading: every method must be invoked from the Unity main thread.
// RoomManager already enforces that contract; the table itself is
// not thread-safe by design.
