// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Rooms/RoomManager.cs
//
// High-level Room API for creating, joining, leaving, and listing rooms.
// Created by NetworkManager and receives room packet callbacks from it.
//
// Threading model:
//   • All public methods MUST be called from the Unity main thread.
//   • HandleRoomPacket() is called by NetworkManager.ProcessPacket() which
//     runs on the main thread (via MainThreadDispatcher).
//
// Lifecycle:
//   1. NetworkManager creates RoomManager in InitialiseNetwork().
//   2. ProcessPacket() routes room-type packets to HandleRoomPacket().
//   3. On cleanup, NetworkManager nulls its reference — no explicit Dispose needed.

        //     in _pendingCreateOrder.

        //     race-proof.  When the server omits it (current gateway), we fall

        //     removed atomically.

        //   trailer — [request_id_len:2 LE][request_id:32 ASCII hex] — so that a
        //   v4.0+ gateway can echo the id in its response.  The response parser
        //   surfaces the echoed value as an optional field; when present, TryMatch
        //   resolves by id directly (race-proof); when absent (pre-v4.0 gateway),
        //   FIFO fallback applies automatically.
        //     (a) SDK request side: BuildCreateRoomPayload appends the trailer.
        //     (b) Gateway response side: echo of the request_id field — pending
        //         deployment of the v4.0 gateway build.
        //     (c) SDK response side: ParseCreateRoomResponse surfaces the echoed id.
        //   Steps (a) and (c) are complete; step (b) activates id-based correlation
        //   end-to-end once the v4.0 gateway is deployed.  In the interim FIFO
