// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Sync/NetworkVariableAttribute.cs
//
// Declarative metadata for NetworkVariable fields and properties.
//
// Primary use case: per-variable bandwidth throttling.  By default every dirty
// NetworkVariable is flushed at the global tick cadence (NetworkManager
// VariableFlushInterval = 30 Hz).  Marking a field with
//  [NetworkVariable(SendRateHz = 10f)]
// caps that variable's outbound rate at 10 Hz independently of its siblings,
// reducing bandwidth for values that change frequently but only need slow
// synchronisation (health bars, ammo counts, kill streaks, …).
//
// Discovery: NetworkBehaviour scans its own type once (via reflection) the
// first time TrackVariable() is called for that type.  Found attributes are
// matched to their corresponding NetworkVariableBase instance by the field /
// property reference (object identity), not by name, so the developer is free
// to rename either side without invalidating the binding.
//
// Performance: the reflection scan happens once per concrete subclass, on a
// single thread (Unity main thread, during OnNetworkSpawn).  The result is
// cached in a per-type dictionary keyed by Type, so subsequent spawns of the
// same NetworkBehaviour subclass do not re-scan.  Per-variable lookup at
// flush time is O(1) — the SendRateHz is copied directly onto each variable
// instance during registration.
