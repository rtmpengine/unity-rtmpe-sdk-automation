// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Sync/NetworkRigidbody.cs
//
// MonoBehaviour component that synchronises a GameObject's 3-D Rigidbody
// physics state (position, rotation, velocity, angular velocity, sleep) over
// the RTMPE network.
//
// ── Architecture ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  Owner (authoritative physics):
//    FixedUpdate() captures the Rigidbody state each physics step.
//    When any enabled field exceeds its send threshold AND the configured
//    send-rate interval has elapsed, a PhysicsSync payload is built and
//    transmitted as PacketType.StateSync (0x40) via the Sync Engine, which
//    broadcasts it to all room members at 30 Hz.
//
//  Non-owner (remote simulation):
//    ApplyRemoteState() is called by NetworkManager when a physics-sync packet
//    arrives for this object.  The received state is stored and applied each
//    FixedUpdate():
//      • MovePosition / MoveRotation smooth the body toward the authoritative
//        position, respecting physics constraints (no teleport through colliders).
//      • The received linear velocity is blended onto the Rigidbody so the
//        physics engine continues simulating between packets (no rubber-banding).
//      • Dead reckoning extrapolates the expected position using the last known
//        velocity for up to _deadReckoningTimeout seconds while no new packet
//        arrives, preventing objects from stopping mid-air between ticks.
//      • If the position error exceeds _snapThreshold, MovePosition snaps
//        immediately instead of lerping, correcting large desync without
//        prolonged visual drift.
//      • When IsSleeping is received, the remote body is put to sleep to stop
//        physics noise on stationary objects.
//
//  Owner reconciliation:
//    When the Sync Engine broadcasts the owner's own state back (because all
//    room members receive each tick), ApplyReconciliation() can optionally
//    apply a server-corrected position.  Currently a no-op placeholder — the
//    owner's local physics simulation is authoritative.
//
// ── Threading ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  All methods run on the Unity main thread.  ApplyRemoteState() is called from
//  NetworkManager (main thread) and stores state into _receivedState, which
//  FixedUpdate() reads on the next physics step (also main thread).  No lock is
//  required because both sites execute on the same thread.
//
// ── Design decisions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  • Uses FixedUpdate (physics timestep) for both capture and application so
//    that Rigidbody.velocity and .angularVelocity reflect the physics engine's
//    actual state, not a mid-frame snapshot.
//  • MovePosition / MoveRotation are preferred over direct position / rotation
//    assignment on non-kinematic bodies: they participate in collision detection
//    within the physics step, preventing tunnelling.
//  • _makeRemoteKinematic: when true, the Rigidbody on non-owner clients is set
//    to kinematic on spawn, and position/rotation are applied directly.  This is
//    appropriate when the owner fully controls the body (e.g. a player character)
//    and remote clients should never simulate physics for it.
//  • Send rate defaults to 20 Hz (below the 30 Hz Sync Engine tick) to reduce
//    bandwidth while still producing smooth results with dead reckoning.
//  • Change detection uses per-field thresholds to suppress sends for micro-
//    movements (floating-point noise, sleep vibrations) that would waste bandwidth.
//  • Sleep state is only included in the payload when it changes, reducing the
//    common-case payload size for active objects.
