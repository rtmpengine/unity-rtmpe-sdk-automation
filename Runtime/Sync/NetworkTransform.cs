// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Sync/NetworkTransform.cs
//
// MonoBehaviour component that synchronises a GameObject's position, rotation,
// and optionally scale over the RTMPE network, with optional client-side
// prediction (CSP) for the owning client.
//
// Design decisions:
//  • Extends NetworkBehaviour — inherits NetworkObjectId, IsOwner,
//    IsSpawned, and the OnNetworkSpawn / OnNetworkDespawn callbacks.
//  • Owner-only sending: only the authoritative owner sends transform updates.
//    All other clients receive server-broadcast StateDelta payloads via the
//    HandleStateSyncPacket handler in NetworkManager.
//  • Two thresholds guard against send spam:
//    - _positionThreshold (0.01 world units): Vector3.Distance check
//    - _rotationThreshold (0.1 degrees):      Quaternion.Angle check
//  • MarkClean() records the last-sent transform so the next Update() compares
//    against that baseline, not the object's initial spawn position.
//  • GetState() / ApplyState() provide a type-safe boundary between Unity
//    transform fields and the serialisation layer, enabling unit testing.
//  • _syncScale defaults to false because scale rarely changes at runtime.
//
// Client-side prediction (CSP) — optional, disabled by default:
//  When _enablePrediction is true the owner client:
//    1. Calls GatherInput() each 30 Hz tick, stamps the tick, pushes it to
//       _inputBuffer.  Game code moves the character immediately (prediction).
//    2. Sends the resulting transform to the server as usual.
//    3. When the server broadcasts back an authoritative StateDelta for this
//       object, ApplyReconciliation() fires (routed by NetworkManager):
//         • Error > _snapThreshold  →  snap directly to server position.
//         • Error > _lerpThreshold  →  start a 100 ms smooth lerp toward
//           the server position (_reconcileTimeLeft drives the blend).
//         • Error <= _lerpThreshold →  accept prediction as-is (no visual pop).
//    4. AcknowledgeUpTo(LocalTick - 1) trims the buffer each reconciliation.
//
//  Non-owning clients are unaffected by the prediction fields — they use the
//  NetworkTransformInterpolator for smooth playback.
//
// Threading: all methods run on the Unity main thread.
