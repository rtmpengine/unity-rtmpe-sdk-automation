// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Sync/PhysicsState2D.cs
//
// Plain value struct holding the 2-D physics fields synchronised over the
// network by NetworkRigidbody2D.
//
// Design decisions:
//  • Uses Vector2 for position/velocity (XY plane only).
//  • Rotation is a single float (Z-axis angle in degrees).
//    Matches Rigidbody2D.rotation which Unity exposes in degrees.
//  • AngularVelocity is a single float (degrees/second).
//    Matches Rigidbody2D.angularVelocity which Unity also exposes in deg/s.
//  • IsSleeping mirrors the 3-D convention; Rigidbody2D.IsSleeping() is the
//    corresponding Unity API call.
