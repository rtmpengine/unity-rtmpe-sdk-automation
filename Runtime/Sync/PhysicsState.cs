// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Sync/PhysicsState.cs
//
// Plain value struct holding the 3-D physics fields synchronised over the
// network by NetworkRigidbody.
//
// Design decisions:
//  • Mirrors TransformState but adds Velocity, AngularVelocity, IsSleeping,
//    and ConstraintMask for Rigidbody-driven objects.  Position and Rotation
//    are included so the physics component is self-contained and does not
//    require a co-located NetworkTransform.
//  • Uses UnityEngine types directly — no intermediate conversion type.
//  • IsSleeping enables remote Rigidbodies to enter sleep state when the owner
//    physics engine idles the body, eliminating micro-movement from floating-
//    point noise on stationary objects.
//  • AngularVelocity is in radians/second (Unity's native Rigidbody unit).
//  • ConstraintMask mirrors RigidbodyConstraints (Unity's bitmask) so that
//    runtime constraint changes (e.g. freezing axes mid-flight) are preserved
//    across the network rather than relying on inspector-set defaults.
