// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Crypto/ReplayWindow.cs
//
// Sliding-bitmap anti-replay window for AEAD-authenticated inbound packets.
//
// Construction mirrors RFC 4303 §3.4.3 (IPsec ESP) and the BoringSSL DTLS
// implementation: a fixed-width bitmap tracks which sequence numbers within
// the window [highest-WindowSize+1 .. highest] have already been observed.
// Sequence numbers below the window or repeats within it are rejected.
//
// Invariants:
//  • Capacity is fixed at 1024 entries — covers >30 s of jitter at 30 Hz on
//    the inbound (gateway→SDK) direction this window guards, while keeping the
//    bitmap to a single 16×u64 array.  The reverse direction (SDK→gateway) is
//    policed independently by the gateway's own anti-replay window
//    (REPLAY_WINDOW_SIZE = 128 ≈ 4.27 s at 30 Hz); the two are sized
//    per-direction and are deliberately not a single end-to-end tolerance, so
//    a client→server packet reordered beyond ~4.27 s is dropped at the gateway
//    regardless of this larger inbound capacity.
//  • The window is keyed externally on (session_id, channel); a fresh
//    session must construct a fresh window so a counter reused across
//    sessions does not falsely register as a replay.
//  • Operations are NOT thread-safe.  The SDK applies the window from the
//    main-thread packet dispatcher (ProcessPacket) so concurrent admission
//    is impossible by construction; introducing a lock would only mask a
//    threading-model violation elsewhere.
