// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Core/GameplayOrderingBuffer.cs
//
// Bounded reorder buffer for gameplay packets that share a 32-bit monotonic
// gameplay sequence (Fix forward-compat scaffold for RPC ↔ StateSync ordering).
//
// Why a bounded buffer:
//   UDP delivers gameplay packets in arrival order, not send order.  When a
//   designer assumes that an RPC carrying "OnPickedUp(itemId)" cannot land
//   before the StateDelta that flipped the item's owner field, every
//   adversarial UDP reorder is a latent gameplay bug.  A bounded reorder
//   queue ahead of the dispatcher resolves the inversion: each handler is
//   only invoked once every prior sequence has either been delivered or has
//   been confirmed lost.
//
// Why bounded:
//   An attacker can replay a flood of low-sequence packets to force the
//   buffer into worst-case occupancy.  Capping the buffer at a small
//   constant defeats the memory-amplification vector while preserving
//   correctness — an arrival whose sequence falls outside the window is
//   delivered immediately rather than queued, accepting a single inversion
//   in exchange for bounded memory.
//
// Sequence comparison uses RFC 1982 modular arithmetic: a 32-bit unsigned
// wraparound after 4 billion packets (~4.5 years at 30 Hz) is handled
// transparently by the sign of (a - b) cast to int.
//
// Threading: not thread-safe.  Callers (NetworkManager dispatcher,
// per-room handler) hold the dispatch monitor on the main thread.
