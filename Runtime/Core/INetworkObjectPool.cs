// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Core/INetworkObjectPool.cs
//
// Pluggable object-pool contract used by SpawnManager for every network
// spawn/despawn.  Pooling is OPTIONAL — when no pool is installed,
// SpawnManager falls back to Object.Instantiate / Object.Destroy (the
// historical behaviour).  Apps with high spawn churn (bullets, hit FX,
// short-lived props) install a pool to avoid per-spawn GC pressure and
// the Instantiate/Destroy cost.
//
// Contract:
//  • Acquire must return a fully-configured GameObject with the same
//    NetworkBehaviour component the prefab has.  It MUST NOT return null
//    on success; instead, throw or return a fresh Instantiate if the
//    pool is empty.  SpawnManager treats a null return as a fatal error.
//  • Release is called instead of Object.Destroy when an object despawns.
//    Implementations SHOULD deactivate the GameObject and keep it for
//    later reuse.  Implementations MAY choose to Destroy rarely-used
//    prefabs to cap pool memory; that decision is purely internal.
//  • All calls happen on the Unity main thread.  Implementations do NOT
//    need to be thread-safe.
//
// Why an interface rather than a concrete class:
//  Different games want wildly different pooling strategies (global pool,
//  per-scene pool, LRU-capped, warm-up on scene load, etc.).  The SDK
//  intentionally ships no built-in pool so we don't paint consumers into
//  a specific design.  Users with no pooling needs pay zero overhead.
