// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Core/OwnershipManager.cs
//
// Manages network object ownership.
//
// Security contract (unchanged from plan, hardened implementation):
//  • Only the SERVER can GRANT ownership transfers.
//  • Clients REQUEST a transfer; the server validates and confirms.
//  • Local state ONLY changes via ApplyOwnershipGrant(), called from
//    the packet handler after the server confirms.
//
// Design notes:
//  • RequestOwnershipTransfer() sends TransferOwnership RPC (Method ID 200)
//    to the server. The server validates and broadcasts OwnershipGrant to all
//    clients. Local state ONLY changes via ApplyOwnershipGrant() (server-authoritative).
