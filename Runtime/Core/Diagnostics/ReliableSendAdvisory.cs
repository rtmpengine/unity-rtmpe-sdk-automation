// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Core/Diagnostics/ReliableSendAdvisory.cs
//
// Surfaces single, process-wide advisories whenever
// `NetworkManager.Send(reliable: true)` cannot engage application-layer
// reliability because one or both halves of the contract is missing.  Two
// distinct causes can produce the same silent downgrade, each with its
// own actionable for the integrator:
//
//   1. The local deployment opt-in (`NetworkSettings.EmitArqSequence`) is
//      disabled.  The SDK has no instruction to emit the 4-byte ARQ
//      sub-header on the wire, so retransmits + DataAck cannot start
//      regardless of what the gateway is willing to do.  Surfaced by
//      `ReliableSendAdvisory.NotifyIfDowngrading`.
//
//   2. The negotiated peer capability set (returned in the SessionAck
//      `gateway_caps` tail) does not contain
//      `CapabilityFlags.ArqAck`.  Either the gateway is a legacy build
//      that never knew about the cap field, or the operator has not set
//      `RTMPE_ADVERTISE_ARQ_CAP=true`.  In either case the gateway will
//      not emit DataAck, so the SDK would loop retransmitting until the
//      attempt cap is reached.  Surfaced by
//      `PeerCapabilityAdvisory.NotifyIfArqUnavailable`.
//
// Why two advisories
// ------------------
// Keeping the two causes on separate latches lets a misconfiguration on
// both sides surface as two distinct, individually-actionable lines in
// the console rather than a single conflated message that elides one of
// the fixes.  Each cause is genuinely a deployment-time event, so the
// warn-once cadence matches the diagnostic interest profile — every
// further `Send(reliable: true)` for the rest of the process re-confirms
// the same misconfiguration and would only add noise.
//
// A third advisory, `ReliableSaturationAdvisory`, is not one of these: it
// reports runtime back-pressure — the retransmit window full of control
// frames — which recurs and is worth a line each time it does.  It carries
// no latch; its caller gates it to one line a second and hands it the
// running count, so the cadence and the figure are the send path's.
//
// Threading
// ---------
// Each configuration advisory's latch is a single int updated via
// Interlocked.CompareExchange.  Callers may invoke the notify entry
// points from any thread; the first successful CAS wins and emits, all
// later callers cheaply observe the latched value and return without
// side effects.  The saturation advisory keeps an emission count the same
// way, for observation only.
//
// Testability
// -----------
// All three are fully pure-managed apart from the single
// UnityEngine.Debug.LogWarning sink, which keeps the types compilable
// into the standalone xunit test project under
// tests/unit/unity-sdk-arq-advisory.  Each exposes a ResetForTests() seam
// that drains its latch or count between fixtures so a test observes a
// clean precondition.
