// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Core/IDamageable.cs
//
// Interface for objects that can receive server-authorised damage via ApplyDamage RPC.
// Lives in the SDK Runtime assembly so NetworkManager can dispatch damage RPCs
// without a compile-time dependency on game-specific types (e.g. HealthController
// in the Samples assembly).
//
// Game code implements this on any component that should receive ApplyDamage (301) RPCs.
