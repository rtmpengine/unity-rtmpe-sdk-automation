// RTMPE SDK — Runtime/Core/SpawnManager.cs
//
// Manages the lifecycle of networked objects: prefab registration,
// local instantiation/destruction, and owner-leave cleanup.
//
// Architecture notes:
//   • SpawnManager is the CENTRAL hub for object lifecycle. It owns the
//     NetworkObjectRegistry and OwnershipManager (exposed as properties).
//   • Spawn() / Despawn() create/destroy locally AND send a packet to
//     the server for relay to other clients in the room. When the server
//     relays a Spawn/Despawn to a receiving client, the NetworkManager
//     packet handler calls CreateLocal() / DestroyLocal() directly.
//   • CreateLocal() / DestroyLocal() are internal so only the SDK itself
//     (or tests via InternalsVisibleTo) can call them. These are the
//     primitives that the server-driven spawn path will invoke.
//   • OnPlayerLeftRoom() handles the DestroyWithOwner contract defined
//     on NetworkBehaviour. For objects with DestroyWithOwner=false, the
//     server is responsible for sending ownership grants — no local
//     mutation occurs here (server-authoritative ownership).
//   • ClearAll() is called on disconnect / room leave to tear down all
//     spawned objects (fires OnNetworkDespawn for each, then destroys GOs).
//   • Object IDs are 64-bit values produced by ObjectIdMath.Compose:
//     high 32 bits = avalanche-mixed digest of the FULL u64 gateway
//     session id, low 32 bits = monotonic per-session counter. The wire
//     field (SpawnPacketBuilder: object_id u64 LE) carries the full 64
//     bits with no truncation, and the digest mixes every session-id byte
//     so reconnects that reuse the low half of a prior session id cannot
//     collide with that session's still-live object ids.
