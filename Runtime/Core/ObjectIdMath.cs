// Pure-arithmetic helpers used by SpawnManager to compose locally-allocated
// 64-bit network object ids.  Kept in its own file (no UnityEngine usage)
// so that xunit-based unit tests can compile-link this exact source without
// pulling in the rest of the SpawnManager surface.  The bit-mixing function
// is the single source of truth for the (session_id, counter) → object_id
// contract — divergence between this file and SpawnManager.GenerateObjectId
// would silently re-introduce the 32-bit truncation collision class the
// helper was created to close.
