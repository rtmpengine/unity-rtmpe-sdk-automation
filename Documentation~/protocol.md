## 1. Packet Header

Every packet starts with a fixed **13-byte binary header** in **little-endian** byte order,
followed by a variable-length payload.

```
Offset  Size  Field        Notes
──────  ────  ───────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  0       2   magic        0x5254  ("RT" in ASCII, bytes: 0x54 0x52)
  2       1   version      3  (protocol version 3)
  3       1   packet_type  PacketType enum value
  4       1   flags        Bitset — see §2
  5       4   sequence     u32 LE — monotonic per connection; doubles as nonce counter
  9       4   payload_len  u32 LE — byte length of the payload that follows
 13      ..   payload      N bytes — format depends on packet_type
```

> **Size validation:** The SDK enforces `payload_len ≤ 1 MiB` (`PacketParser.ExtractPayload`).
> Packets exceeding this limit are dropped.

### C# constants (`PacketProtocol`)

```csharp
PacketProtocol.MAGIC        = 0x5254
PacketProtocol.VERSION      = 3
PacketProtocol.HEADER_SIZE  = 13
```

## 2. Flag Bits

The `flags` byte is a bitmask. Multiple flags may be set simultaneously.

| Bit    | Hex    | Name              | Meaning |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Bit 0  | `0x01` | `Compressed`      | Payload is LZ4-compressed (applied before AEAD when `CompressIfBeneficial` shrinks the payload) |
| Bit 1  | `0x02` | `Encrypted`       | Payload is ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encrypted |
| Bit 2  | `0x04` | `Reliable`        | Packet requires acknowledged (reliable) delivery — marks it for the gateway's KCP/ARQ reliability layer |
| Bit 3  | `0x08` | `EnhancedRpc`     | `Rpc` (0x50) payload uses the 27-byte Enhanced RPC header |
| Bit 4  | `0x10` | `GameplayOrdered` | Payload begins with a 4-byte LE gameplay sequence used to order RPC and StateSync against each other |
| Bit 5  | `0x20` | `AppSequence`     | An application-level monotonic sequence (4-byte LE) is bound into the AEAD AAD |
| Bit 6  | `0x40` | `SealedApiKey`    | `HandshakeInit` (0x05) carries the API key as an X25519 sealed box rather than the symmetric PSK envelope (see §4 Step 1). **Client → server only**, set solely on `HandshakeInit` |

```csharp
// C# constants (PacketFlags)
PacketFlags.Compressed      = 0x01
PacketFlags.Encrypted       = 0x02
PacketFlags.Reliable        = 0x04
PacketFlags.EnhancedRpc     = 0x08
PacketFlags.GameplayOrdered = 0x10
PacketFlags.AppSequence     = 0x20
PacketFlags.SealedApiKey    = 0x40
```

**Compression order:** `Lz4Compressor.CompressIfBeneficial` is applied to the
plaintext payload *before* AEAD sealing. The `Compressed` flag is set in both
the header and the AAD so the gateway verifies it was not tampered with in
transit. The SDK decompresses transparently; handlers always receive
uncompressed plaintext.

**Directional flag.** `SealedApiKey` (0x40) is the one bit that is *not*
bidirectional. The SDK sets it on the outbound `HandshakeInit` but never expects
it inbound, so it is excluded from the SDK's inbound `KNOWN_FLAGS` mask (which
stays `0x3F`); the gateway, which receives `HandshakeInit`, includes `0x40` in
its own `KNOWN_FLAGS`. Every other flag bit is identical on both sides — this
asymmetry is intentional.

## 3. Packet Types

> **Transport.** With the shipped `UdpTransport`, every packet type below
> travels over the SDK's single UDP socket. Packets needing acknowledged
> delivery additionally set `FLAG_RELIABLE` (§2); the gateway may route those
> over its KCP transport. The "Reliable" column indicates which types the SDK
> sends with `FLAG_RELIABLE`.

## 4. Handshake Sequence

The connection is established with a 4-step exchange. With the shipped
`UdpTransport` these packets travel over the SDK's single UDP socket; they
carry `FLAG_RELIABLE` so the gateway delivers them reliably.

```
Step  Packet            Hex    Dir   Payload
────  ────────────────  ─────  ────  ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  1   HandshakeInit     0x05   C→S   sealed-box (preferred): [eph_pub:32][ChaCha20-Poly1305(api_key)]
                                      legacy PSK:             [nonce:12][ChaCha20-Poly1305(PSK, api_key)]
  2   Challenge         0x06   S→C   [eph_pub:32][static_pub:32][ed25519_sig:64]
  3   HandshakeResponse 0x07   C→S   [client_pub:32]
  4   SessionAck        0x08   S→C   [crypto_id:4 LE][jwt_len:2 LE][jwt:N]
                                      [rc_len:2 LE][reconnect_token:R]
                                      (first AEAD-encrypted packet)
```

### Step 1 — HandshakeInit

The client carries its API key encrypted inside the first packet so the gateway
can authenticate it cheaply — before spending an ECDH/Ed25519 Challenge on an
unauthenticated peer. Two envelope formats exist; the SDK selects the
**sealed-box** path whenever a gateway X25519 key is configured and falls back to
the **PSK** path otherwise. The chosen format is signalled by the `SealedApiKey`
flag (0x40, §2): set for sealed-box, clear for PSK.

**Sealed-box envelope (preferred — `FLAG_SEALED_API_KEY` set).** The API key is
sealed to the gateway's static X25519 public key as an anonymous sealed box. No
shared secret is distributed: the developer needs only the gateway's public key,
the same value surfaced as the dashboard Sealed-Box Public Key.

```
plaintext    = [api_key_len:2 LE u16][api_key_bytes:N]
(sk_E, pk_E) = X25519 keygen                       // fresh per handshake
shared       = X25519(sk_E, gateway_static_pub)
key          = HKDF-SHA256(ikm  = shared,
                           salt = pk_E ‖ gateway_static_pub,
                           info = "RTMPE-api-key-seal-v1", len = 32)
payload      = [pk_E:32][ChaCha20-Poly1305.Seal(key, nonce=0¹², plaintext, aad=∅)]
```

The all-zero nonce is sound because the per-handshake ephemeral key makes `key`
unique for every seal. The box is at least 50 bytes (32-byte ephemeral key +
2-byte length prefix + 16-byte Poly1305 tag). The gateway opens it with its
matching X25519 private key.

**PSK envelope (legacy fallback — `FLAG_SEALED_API_KEY` clear).** When no
sealed-box key is configured, the API key is encrypted under the symmetric
pre-shared key (`GATEWAY_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_HEX`):

```
plaintext = [api_key_len:2 LE u16][api_key_bytes:N]
nonce     = [salt:4 random (RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes)][counter:8 LE process-monotonic u64]
payload   = [nonce:12][ChaCha20-Poly1305.Seal(PSK, nonce, plaintext, aad=∅)]
```

**AAD is empty in both formats.** An earlier revision bound the PSK ciphertext to
the client's source IP/port through the AAD, but a NAT'd client cannot observe
its post-NAT address, so the gateway — which sees the post-NAT source — could
never reproduce the AAD and rejected every real-world (NAT'd) handshake. Channel
binding is instead provided by the Ed25519 transcript signature in the Challenge
(Step 2), computed over `SHA-256(HandshakeInit ciphertext)`: a relayed or spoofed
`HandshakeInit` yields a different transcript and an invalid signature.

### Step 2 — Challenge

Gateway proves its identity using an Ed25519 signature:

```
payload = [eph_pub:32][static_pub:32][ed25519_sig:64]
           X25519 key   pinned key    Sign(static_priv, transcript_hash)

Total: 128 bytes — ParseChallenge() validates exactly 128 bytes
```

The signature is **not** over the bare ephemeral key. It covers the canonical
handshake transcript hash — a 32-byte SHA-256 digest binding the protocol
version, cipher-suite identifier, gateway static and ephemeral public keys, and
`SHA-256(HandshakeInit ciphertext)` — which ties the Challenge to this exact
handshake and closes cross-session replay and version / cipher-suite downgrade.
The SDK verifies the Ed25519 signature using RFC 8032 §5.1.7.
If pinning is configured (`PinnedServerPublicKeyHex`), the static public key
must match. Verification failure aborts the handshake.

### Step 3 — HandshakeResponse

```
payload = [client_pub:32]              // client's X25519 ephemeral public key
          [preferred_wire_format:1]    // negotiated state-sync wire format (2 or 4)
          [client_caps:4 LE]?          // optional capability advertisement
```

Minimum size: **33 bytes** (32-byte key + 1-byte wire-format selector). When
the client advertises capabilities a 4-byte little-endian caps tail is
appended (37 bytes); the tail is omitted entirely when no capabilities are
set, keeping the packet byte-compatible with a pre-capability gateway.

### Step 4 — SessionAck

```
payload = [crypto_id:4 LE][jwt_len:2 LE][jwt:jwt_len][rc_len:2 LE][reconnect_token:rc_len]
          [gateway_caps:4 LE]?    // optional — gateway capability advertisement
```

- `crypto_id` — a server-assigned `u32` used as the high 4 bytes of every subsequent AEAD nonce.
- `jwt` — EdDSA (Ed25519) signed JWT session token (UTF-8 encoded). The
  SDK validates the signature against the configured Ed25519 public key
  (`NetworkSettings.jwtSigningKeyHex`); RFC 8725 §3.1 `alg=none` is
  rejected unconditionally.
- `reconnect_token` — opaque single-use token that resumes the session via
  `ReconnectInit` (0x09). Used by `NetworkManager.Reconnect()`. Also used by
  the HKDF N-8 path to derive an IP-migration HMAC key.

After Step 4, both sides have derived two directional HKDF-SHA256 keys plus
a third HKDF expansion for the IP-migration HMAC key (see
[Architecture §4](architecture.md#4-crypto-layer)). All subsequent packets use
AEAD encryption.

### Reconnect shortcut — ReconnectInit (0x09)

After a transient drop (heartbeat timeout, transport error, IP migration), a
client holding a valid `reconnect_token` may call `NetworkManager.Reconnect()`
and skip re-sending the API-key envelope. The server replies with a normal `Challenge` (0x06),
and the full ECDH exchange resumes from that point.

```
payload = [token_len:2 LE u16][token:N UTF-8]
          [proof:32]?    (optional HMAC-SHA256 of token, for IP migration)
```

- `token` — the UTF-8 `reconnect_token` issued at the last `SessionAck`.
- `proof` — HMAC-SHA256(ip_migration_key, token_bytes). Only present when the
  SDK holds a non-null `ip_migration_key` — included so the gateway accepts a
  reconnect from a new source IP (WiFi ↔ 4G handoff).

The token is **single-use**: the gateway consumes it atomically on receipt. On
timeout the SDK clears its stored token so repeated attempts do not feed stale
tokens that always fail.

## 5. Raw Binary Packets (0x05–0x09)

> ⚠ **Critical:** Packets `0x05` through `0x09` use a custom binary layout, **NOT FlatBuffers**.
> Attempting to parse them as FlatBuffers tables will produce garbage or a crash.

| Packet           | Exact byte layout |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `HandshakeInit`  | sealed-box (`FLAG_SEALED_API_KEY` set): `[eph_pub:32][ct+tag:N]`, ≥ 50 bytes — see §4 Step 1. Legacy PSK (flag clear): `[nonce:12][ct+tag:N]`, N = plaintext + 16 (Poly1305 tag) |
| `Challenge`      | `[eph_pub:32][static_pub:32][ed25519_sig:64]` = 128 bytes exactly |
| `HandshakeResponse` | `[client_pub:32][preferred_wire_format:1][client_caps:4 LE]?` — 33 bytes (37 with the optional caps tail) |
| `SessionAck`     | `[crypto_id:4][jwt_len:2][jwt:N][rc_len:2][rc:R][gateway_caps:4 LE]?` (first AEAD-encrypted) |
| `ReconnectInit`  | `[token_len:2][token:N][proof:32]?` — see §4 reconnect shortcut |

---

## 6. AEAD Encryption on the Wire

After the handshake, **every packet is AEAD-encrypted**. The `FLAG_ENCRYPTED` bit (`0x02`)
is set in the header flags.

### Encryption (outbound)

```
1. Optionally compress the application payload:
     compressed = Lz4Compressor.CompressIfBeneficial(payload, out didCompress)
     if didCompress:
         application_payload = compressed
         flags |= 0x01                  // set FLAG_COMPRESSED BEFORE AAD
     else:
         application_payload = payload   // unchanged

2. Build plaintext (sealed under AEAD):
     plaintext = [origSeq:4 LE u32][application_payload]

3. Compute AAD (2 bytes) — using flags AFTER compression step but BEFORE step 5:
     aad[0] = packetType
     aad[1] = flags & ~0x02             // EXCLUDES Encrypted;
                                        // INCLUDES Compressed (0x01) when set;
                                        // INCLUDES Reliable (0x04) when set.

4. Build nonce (12 bytes):
     nonce[0..7]  = outboundNonceCounter (u64 LE, starts at 0, increments per packet)
     nonce[8..11] = cryptoId             (u32 LE, from SessionAck)

5. Encrypt:
     ciphertext = ChaCha20-Poly1305.Seal(
         key   = SessionKeys.EncryptKey,
         nonce = nonce,
         aad   = aad,
         input = plaintext
     )
     // ciphertext length = plaintext length + 16 (Poly1305 tag appended)

6. Update header:
     header.sequence    = nonce counter   (receiver reconstructs nonce from this)
     header.flags      |= 0x02            (set Encrypted flag — AFTER AAD is fixed)
     header.payload_len = len(ciphertext)
```

> **Why `FLAG_COMPRESSED` is covered by AAD:** a MITM that strips the flag
> would cause the receiver to skip decompression and treat raw compressed
> bytes as the application payload. Including the flag in AAD causes Poly1305
> to reject any such tampering.

### Decryption (inbound)

```
1. Reconstruct nonce:
     nonce[0..7]  = header.sequence (treated as u64, zero-extended from u32)
     nonce[8..11] = cryptoId        (u32 LE, stored after SessionAck)

2. Compute AAD (2 bytes):
     aad[0] = packetType
     aad[1] = header.flags & ~0x02   // strip Encrypted bit only.
                                     // Preserves FLAG_COMPRESSED (0x01) and
                                     // FLAG_RELIABLE (0x04) exactly as sent.

3. Decrypt:
     plaintext = ChaCha20-Poly1305.Open(
         key   = SessionKeys.DecryptKey,
         nonce = nonce,
         aad   = aad,
         input = ciphertext
     )
     // Poly1305 tag verification failure → drop packet silently

4. Recover original sequence and payload:
     origSeq          = plaintext[0..3]  (u32 LE)
     header.sequence  = origSeq          (restored)
     inner_payload    = plaintext[4..]

5. Decompress if flagged:
     if (header.flags & 0x01) != 0:          // FLAG_COMPRESSED was set
         payload = Lz4Compressor.Decompress(inner_payload)
     else:
         payload = inner_payload

6. Clear flags and restore payload_len:
     header.flags      &= ~(0x01 | 0x02)   // strip Encrypted + Compressed;
                                           // downstream handlers always see plaintext.
     header.payload_len = len(payload)
```

---

## 7. Nonce Construction

The 12-byte AEAD nonce encodes the per-packet counter and the server-assigned session ID:

```
Offset  Size  Content

  0       8   outboundNonceCounter  (u64 LE — monotonic, starts at 0)
  8       4   cryptoId              (u32 LE — received in SessionAck)
```

> The counter is a `u64` on the gateway (Rust) but the SDK header `sequence` field
> is `u32`. The SDK stores the counter in bytes `[0..3]` LE with bytes `[4..7]` = `0x00`
> (zero-extended from u32 to u64). This provides 2³² ≈ 4 billion unique nonces per
> session — sufficient for continuous 30 Hz game traffic for ~4.5 years.

### Nonce exhaustion (hard stop)

The SDK tracks its outbound counter as a `long` starting at `-1`. The first
`Interlocked.Increment` returns `0`. Two thresholds, kept in step with the
gateway, protect against counter exhaustion:

| Threshold                          | Value (constant)              | Effect |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| `OutboundNonceExhaustionThreshold` | `(long)uint.MaxValue + 1`     | Hard stop — SDK calls `Disconnect()` and logs an error |
| Near-exhaustion warning            | threshold − `1_048_576`       | `Debug.LogWarning` — ~9.7 h remaining at 30 Hz |

Any packet that would use a counter value ≥ the hard stop is refused; the
session must be fully re-established.

**Anti-replay:** Each direction has its own sliding-window tracker. The SDK guards
inbound (gateway → SDK) packets with a **1024-entry** window (`ReplayWindow.WindowSize
= 1024`, ~34 s at 30 Hz); the gateway guards inbound (SDK → gateway) packets with a
**128-packet** window (`REPLAY_WINDOW_SIZE = 128`, a `u128` bitmap, ~4.27 s at 30 Hz).
A counter beyond the window (too old) is rejected before AEAD; a duplicate within the
window is detected only after successful AEAD verification, so a forged packet can
never poison the window. AEAD tag failure always causes a silent drop.

## 8. Room Operation Payloads

Room packets carry `FLAG_RELIABLE` (reliable delivery) and, once the session
is established, are AEAD-encrypted.

### RoomCreate (0x20) — client → server

```
[name_len:2 LE u16][name:name_len UTF-8]
[max_players:1 u8]
[is_public:1 bool]
```

### RoomJoin (0x21) — client → server

A single layout is always sent. Supply either `room_id` or `room_code`; leave the
other field empty (zero-length).

```
[room_id_len:2 LE u16][room_id:room_id_len UTF-8]
[room_code_len:2 LE u16][room_code:room_code_len UTF-8]
[display_name_len:2 LE u16][display_name:display_name_len UTF-8]
```

- **Join by room ID:** set `room_id` to the UUID; `room_code` is empty (`room_code_len = 0`).
- **Join by room code:** set `room_code` to the 6-char code; `room_id` is empty (`room_id_len = 0`).

### RoomLeave (0x22) — client → server

```
(empty payload)
```

### RoomList (0x23) — client → server

```
[public_only:1 bool]
```

### Server → Client room responses

```
// Room created / joined response:
[result_code:1]   0x00 = success, 0x01 = error
[room_id_len:2 LE][room_id:N UTF-8]
[room_code_len:2 LE][room_code:N UTF-8]
[room_name_len:2 LE][room_name:N UTF-8]
[player_count:1][max_players:1]
[local_player_id_len:2 LE][local_player_id:N UTF-8]

// Room list response:
[count:2 LE u16]
  per room:
  [room_id_len:2 LE][room_id:N]
  [room_name_len:2 LE][room_name:N]
  [room_code_len:2 LE][room_code:N]
  [player_count:1][max_players:1][is_public:1]

// Player joined event:
[player_id_len:2 LE][player_id:N UTF-8]
[display_name_len:2 LE][display_name:N UTF-8]
[is_host:1 bool]

// Player left event:
[player_id_len:2 LE][player_id:N UTF-8]
```

> **String encoding:** All strings are UTF-8. `RoomPacketBuilder.SafeEncodeUtf8`
> truncates strings to a maximum byte count while respecting multi-byte character
> boundaries (no split code points).

## 9. Spawn / Despawn Payloads

Spawn and despawn packets carry `FLAG_RELIABLE` (reliable delivery) and are
AEAD-encrypted.

### SpawnRequest / Spawn (0x30) payload

```
[prefab_id:4 LE u32]
[object_id:8 LE u64]
[owner_len:2 LE u16][owner_player_id:owner_len UTF-8]
[pos_x:4 LE f32][pos_y:4 LE f32][pos_z:4 LE f32]
[rot_x:4 LE f32][rot_y:4 LE f32][rot_z:4 LE f32][rot_w:4 LE f32]
```

Minimum size: 4 + 8 + 2 + 0 + 12 + 16 = **42 bytes** (empty owner string).

> **Float encoding:** All floats are encoded little-endian using
> `BitConverter.SingleToInt32Bits` + explicit byte extraction
> (`SpawnPacketBuilder.WriteF32LE`). This is endian-safe on all Unity target platforms.

### DespawnRequest / Despawn (0x31) payload

```
[object_id:8 LE u64]
```

---

## 10. State Sync Payload

`StateSync` (0x40) packets are AEAD-encrypted and sent **unreliably** (no
`FLAG_RELIABLE`) for minimum latency — loss is acceptable because a fresh
snapshot follows at 30 Hz. The type is **bidirectional**: clients send
transform updates with it, and the gateway relays / snapshots state back with
it. Two payload shapes share the type.

### Client → server: transform update

`NetworkTransform` sends a **52-byte** payload (no `changed_mask`) — the 48-byte
transform core followed by a trailing 4-byte input tick:

```
[object_id:8 LE u64]                                            // offset 0
[pos_x:4 LE f32][pos_y:4 LE f32][pos_z:4 LE f32]                // offset 8
[rot_x:4 LE f32][rot_y:4 LE f32][rot_z:4 LE f32][rot_w:4 LE f32] // offset 20
[scl_x:4 LE f32][scl_y:4 LE f32][scl_z:4 LE f32]                // offset 36
[input_tick:4 LE u32]                                          // offset 48
```

Total: **52 bytes** (`TransformPacketBuilder.BuildUpdatePayloadInto`,
`PAYLOAD_SIZE_WITH_TICK`); the leading 48 bytes are byte-identical to the
tick-less `PAYLOAD_SIZE` layout and the gateway accepts both lengths. When
quantization is enabled the SDK instead emits a **29-byte** quantized variant
(`BuildQuantizedUpdatePayloadInto`, `QUANTIZED_PAYLOAD_SIZE_WITH_TICK`) whose
first byte is a `FLAG_QUANTIZED` (`0x01`) control byte; the shapes are
distinguished by total length.

### Server → client: StateDelta

The gateway relays state as a variable-length **StateDelta** carrying only the
components that changed (parsed by `TransformPacketParser.TryParseStateDelta`):

```
[object_id:8 LE u64]
[changed_mask:1 u8]   bit 0 = position, bit 1 = rotation, bit 2 = scale, bit 3 = input_tick, bit 4 = server_tick
[if changed_mask & 0x01 (position)]:
    [pos_x:4 LE f32][pos_y:4 LE f32][pos_z:4 LE f32]
[if changed_mask & 0x02 (rotation)]:
    [rot_x:4 LE f32][rot_y:4 LE f32][rot_z:4 LE f32][rot_w:4 LE f32]
[if changed_mask & 0x04 (scale)]:
    [scl_x:4 LE f32][scl_y:4 LE f32][scl_z:4 LE f32]
[if changed_mask & 0x08 (input_tick)]:
    [input_tick:4 LE u32]
[if changed_mask & 0x10 (server_tick)]:
    [server_tick:4 LE u32]
```

Minimum size: **9 bytes** (object_id + empty mask). Maximum size:
8 + 1 + 12 + 16 + 12 + 4 + 4 = **57 bytes** (all fields present, including the
input_tick and server_tick trailing u32s). Only bits 5–7 of `changed_mask` are
reserved (`KnownMask = 0x1F`) — a payload that sets any of them is rejected.

---

## 11. RPC Payloads

RPC packets carry `FLAG_RELIABLE` (reliable delivery) and are AEAD-encrypted.

### Rpc (0x50) — client → peers / server

The shipped `[RtmpeRpc]` path sets `FLAG_ENHANCED_RPC` (0x08) and uses the
**27-byte Enhanced RPC header** (`EnhancedRpcPacketBuilder`), which carries the
`object_id` and delivery `target` the legacy format lacked:

```
[method_id  :4 LE u32]   FNV-1a("TypeName.MethodName")
[sender_id  :8 LE u64]   gateway session ID (0 is rejected as spoofed)
[request_id :4 LE u32]   client-assigned correlation ID
[object_id  :8 LE u64]   NetworkBehaviour.NetworkObjectId
[target     :1 u8]       RpcTarget — All 0x00, Others 0x01, Server 0x02, AllBuffered 0x03
[rpc_flags  :1 u8]       reserved (0x00)
[param_count:1 u8]       number of typed parameters that follow
[params…]                typed parameter stream (RpcSerializer format)
```

> **Legacy format (deprecated).** A build without `FLAG_ENHANCED_RPC` emits the
> older `[method_id:4][sender_id:8][request_id:4][payload_len:2][payload]`
> layout from the `[Obsolete]` `RpcPacketBuilder`. New code must not emit it;
> it is retained only for backward compatibility.

### RpcResponse (0x51) — server → client

```
[request_id:4 LE u32]
[method_id:4 LE u32]
[sender_id:8 LE u64]
[success:1 bool]
[error_code:2 LE u16]
[payload_len:2 LE u16]
[payload:payload_len bytes]
```

### Built-in RPC: ApplyDamage

| Field     | Type    | Value |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| method_id | u32     | `RpcMethodId.ApplyDamage` (= 301) |
| payload   | 12 bytes | `[object_id:8 LE u64][damage:4 LE i32]` |

---

## 12. NetworkVariable Wire Format (VariableUpdate — 0x41)

`VariableUpdate` (0x41) is the dedicated packet type for replicating dirty
`NetworkVariable` values. It carries `FLAG_RELIABLE` (reliable delivery) and is
flushed at 30 Hz by the SDK for every owned, spawned object that has at least
one dirty variable. On the server it is relayed to all other clients in the room.

### Top-level payload

```
[object_id:8 LE u64]
[tick:4 LE u32]            // sender's local tick at flush time
[var_count:1 u8]
per variable:
  [var_id:2 LE u16]
  [value_len:2 LE u16]
  [value_bytes:value_len]
```

The 4-byte `[var_id][value_len]` prefix lets receivers skip entries with
unknown variable IDs without losing alignment for the rest of the packet.

### Per-type value encoding

| Type                          | Encoding |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| `NetworkVariableInt`          | 4 bytes LE i32 (`BinaryWriter.Write(int)`) |
| `NetworkVariableFloat`        | 4 bytes LE f32 (`BinaryWriter.Write(float)`) |
| `NetworkVariableBool`         | 1 byte — `0x01` true, `0x00` false |
| `NetworkVariableVector3`      | 12 bytes — `[x:4][y:4][z:4]` LE f32 |
| `NetworkVariableQuaternion`   | 16 bytes — `[x:4][y:4][z:4][w:4]` LE f32 |
| `NetworkVariableString`       | `[utf8_len:2 LE u16][utf8_bytes:N]` — the 2-byte length prefix is part of `value_bytes` |

> `BinaryWriter.Write(float)` and `BinaryWriter.Write(int)` produce little-endian output
> on all Unity platforms (x86-64, ARM LE, iOS, Android). Spawn/transform floats use the
> explicit `SingleToInt32Bits` pattern for additional clarity and big-endian portability.

### Late-join snapshot (v1.1)

When another player joins the current room, the SDK automatically re-flags
every `NetworkVariable` on every locally-owned, spawned object as dirty. The
next 30 Hz flush emits a `VariableUpdate` that carries the full current value
of every tracked variable, so the newly-joined client sees correct state
within ~33 ms instead of waiting for the next application-level value change.

The wire format is identical to a regular flush — there is no separate
"snapshot" packet type.

---

## 13. Heartbeat Packets

Heartbeat packets carry **no payload** (empty body). The 13-byte standard header is
sufficient for keep-alive purposes; the gateway identifies them by `packet_type = 0x03`.

| Packet | Hex | Direction | Interval |
|--------|-----|-----------|----------|
| `Heartbeat`    | 0x03 | C→S | Every `HeartbeatIntervalMs` (default 5 000 ms) |
| `HeartbeatAck` | 0x04 | S→C | Immediately on receipt of Heartbeat |

Liveness requires **two** conditions before an `OnDisconnected` event with
`DisconnectReason.ConnectionLost` is raised: the missed-`HeartbeatAck` counter
must reach three **and** no AEAD-authenticated `HeartbeatAck` must have arrived
within the liveness-grace window (default ≈ 30 s — twice the three-miss span).
The wall-clock grace is a second, independent witness: it forgives a transient
stall that recovers and delivers a real ack inside the window, and it keeps a
starved miss-counter from masking a genuine outage. Only an authenticated
`HeartbeatAck` refreshes the liveness anchor — other inbound traffic does not.
See `HeartbeatManager` and Architecture §5/§9. (The `Timeout` reason is reserved
for a failed **initial** handshake or **reconnect** that exceeds
`NetworkSettings.connectionTimeoutMs` — see `ConnectionTimeoutRoutine` in
`NetworkManager.cs`.)

---

## 14. Disconnect Packet

```
Hex:  0xFF
Dir:  C↔S (either side may send)
Enc:  Encrypted (FLAG_ENCRYPTED set if session is established)
Body: empty (no payload)
```

The SDK sends a `Disconnect` packet on `NetworkManager.Disconnect()` before closing
the socket, giving the gateway a chance to clean up the session synchronously.
The packet carries no payload; the reason is implicit (connection closure).
