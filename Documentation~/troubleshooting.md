# Troubleshooting Guide

> SDK Version: `com.rtmpe.sdk 2.0.11`

Common issues encountered when integrating the RTMPE SDK, with diagnostic
steps and fixes. Each section leads with the symptom followed by a checklist.

---

## Connection issues

### Symptom: `OnConnectionFailed` fires with "Connection timeout." or "Reconnect timeout."

The handshake did not complete within `NetworkSettings.connectionTimeoutMs`
(default 10 000 ms).

**Diagnostic checklist:**

- [ ] Is the gateway reachable? On a shell:
      `nc -u <host> 7777` (Linux/macOS) or equivalent UDP test.
- [ ] Is outbound UDP 7777 allowed through the user's firewall and router?
      RTMPE uses UDP only — TCP rules do not apply.
- [ ] Is `Settings.pinnedServerPublicKeyHex` set to the correct 64-char hex
      key for the target environment? A key mismatch causes the Ed25519
      signature check on the `Challenge` to fail; the SDK aborts the
      handshake and the timeout coroutine fires `OnConnectionFailed`
      shortly after.
- [ ] Is `Settings.apiKeyPskHex` the 64-char hex secret your gateway operator
      provided out of band (it matches `GATEWAY_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_HEX` and
      is **not** shown on the dashboard, and is **not** the gateway public key)?
      A wrong PSK means the gateway can't decrypt the API key in `HandshakeInit`
      and silently drops the packet.
- [ ] Is the client system clock within 5 minutes of UTC? JWT `nbf` / `exp`
      claims are validated server-side; a skewed clock causes silent token
      rejection after a successful handshake.

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Cause                                   | Fix |
|-----------------------------------------|-----|
| Wrong environment PSK                   | Verify `Settings.apiKeyPskHex` matches the API-key PSK configured on the gateway. |
| Wrong pinned public key                 | Verify `Settings.pinnedServerPublicKeyHex` matches the gateway's Ed25519 public key for the target environment. |
| Corporate NAT drops unsolicited UDP     | Consider a WebSocket transport via `NetworkManager.SetTransportFactory` + a WebSocket-to-UDP bridge on the server side. |
| Routing probe fell back to loopback     | Check the Unity Console for `[RTMPE] UdpTransport: routing probe failed …` — common in isolated test containers. The AEAD AAD of `HandshakeInit` will contain the loopback IP instead of the real outgoing interface, and the gateway will reject it. |

---

### Symptom: Connection drops after ~15–30 seconds of idle

The SDK sends a `Heartbeat` every `heartbeatIntervalMs` (default 5 000 ms).
`DisconnectReason.ConnectionLost` is raised only when **both** conditions hold:
three consecutive `HeartbeatAck` responses are missed **and** no
AEAD-authenticated `HeartbeatAck` has arrived within the liveness-grace window
(default ≈ 30 s, twice the three-miss span). The grace window forgives a brief
stall that recovers with a real ack; only a `HeartbeatAck` refreshes it (other
inbound traffic does not), so keep `heartbeatIntervalMs` low enough that the ack
cadence stays inside the window.

- [ ] Is the Unity Editor paused? The network thread continues running, but
      `MainThreadDispatcher` does not drain actions while paused — callbacks
      appear to stop.
- [ ] Is `heartbeatIntervalMs` above `15_000`? With 3-miss tolerance the
      server-side session TTL is exceeded before the next heartbeat arrives.
- [ ] Is the application going to the background on mobile? Handle
      `OnApplicationPause(true)` by calling `Disconnect()` and `Reconnect()`
      on resume — the stored reconnect token makes this cheap.

---

### Symptom: Reconnect loop — connects then immediately disconnects

- [ ] Inspect the `DisconnectReason` argument in `OnDisconnected`. Compare
      against the enum in [API Reference §DisconnectReason](api/index.md#disconnectreason-enum).
- [ ] If the disconnect carries `ConnectionLost` immediately after
      `OnConnected`, the gateway rejected the first encrypted packet — typical
      causes are nonce-counter mismatch between SDK and gateway, or a server
      reboot that invalidated your `cryptoId`.
- [ ] If `OnAutoRejoinAttempt` fires followed immediately by an `OnRoomError`,
      the server has evicted the room UUID. Disable
      `autoRejoinLastRoomOnReconnect` and show a room-selection UI instead.

---

### Symptom: `CanReconnect` is false after a drop

The SDK wipes the reconnect token on:

- explicit `Disconnect()`;
- handshake or ACK timeouts (the token has been consumed or is unusable);
- server-initiated `Disconnect`.

If your use case needs guaranteed resumption after those events, you must
call `Connect(apiKey)` with fresh credentials.

---

## Authentication issues

### Symptom: Handshake succeeds but the first room call fails with "invalid token"

- [ ] Is the JWT valid? `NetworkManager.Instance.JwtToken` is a `RedactedString`
      that logs as `<redacted>`; call `.Reveal()` to obtain the raw token, then
      decode the `exp` claim (`jwt.io` or equivalent). A `401` from the Room Service
      REST API indicates expiration or a signing-key mismatch between the
      gateway and Room Service.
- [ ] Is the system clock synchronised? Token TTLs default to 5 minutes. A
      clock drift greater than 5 minutes causes `exp` rejection.
- [ ] Are you using the correct environment's token? Dev tokens are signed
      with a different HMAC key than production tokens and are rejected by
      the production Room Service.

---

### Symptom: Auth token expires during a long session

The SDK does not auto-refresh the session JWT. When a token expires the
gateway ends the session, which the SDK surfaces through `OnDisconnected` —
typically with `DisconnectReason.ServerRequest` (or `Timeout` if a subsequent
reconnect cannot complete). In your `OnDisconnected` handler, when
`CanReconnect` is `false`, re-authenticate from scratch via `Connect(apiKey)`;
the reconnect-token path does not refresh an expired auth context.

---

## State synchronisation issues

### Symptom: `NetworkVariable` values never update on remote clients

- [ ] Was the `NetworkBehaviour` registered via `SpawnManager.Spawn()`? Objects
      instantiated with Unity's `Instantiate` are not tracked by the SDK.
- [ ] Is `NetworkBehaviour.NetworkObjectId` consistent between sender and
      receiver? Log it on both sides with
      `Debug.Log($"id={obj.NetworkObjectId}")`.
- [ ] Is the `NetworkVariable` created in `OnNetworkSpawn()`? Creating it in
      `Awake()` / `Start()` leaves `IsOwner` undefined at construction time
      and the variable is not tracked by the send loop.
- [ ] Are you writing `Value` on a non-owner? The setter is ignored on
      non-owners — guard with `if (!IsOwner) return;` before any write.

---

### Symptom: Late-joiner sees default NetworkVariable values until the owner writes to them (v1.0 only)

Fixed in v1.1 — `SpawnManager.MarkAllVariablesDirtyForResync` is now auto-called
on `RoomManager.OnPlayerJoined`, and the joiner receives a full snapshot
within one 30 Hz tick. Upgrade to 1.1.0.

For v1.0, work around this by having the owner re-assign the variable's
current value on `OnPlayerJoined`:

```csharp
NetworkManager.Instance.Rooms.OnPlayerJoined += _ =>
{
    if (_health.IsOwner) _health.Value = _health.Value;
};
```

---

### Symptom: Silent packet loss — state lags behind without error

- [ ] Is `NetworkManager.LastRttMs` consistently high or spiking?
      `> 200 ms` on a LAN indicates significant packet loss. Open the Unity
      Profiler's Network view for deeper analysis.
- [ ] Is the connection operating under heavy packet loss (> 20 %)? At this
      level even packets marked reliable observe significant latency. Consider
      reducing tick rate or switching to a closer region.

---

### Symptom: a spawned object's `IsOwner` is always `false` (the player never moves)

`IsOwner` is `true` only for an object created through the SDK's spawn system
with the local player as its owner. If `Update()` keeps logging *"not the
owner"*, the object running that code is almost certainly not the one you
spawned:

- [ ] Is the object created with `NetworkManager.Instance.Spawner.Spawn(...)`?
      A scene-placed (or `Instantiate`d) `NetworkBehaviour` is never networked,
      so its `IsOwner` is permanently `false`. The networked player must come
      from `Spawn`.
- [ ] Did `Spawn` return non-`null`? When the prefab id is not registered,
      `Spawn` logs `[SpawnManager] Spawn: prefab {id} is not registered` and
      returns `null` — assign the result and check it. Register the prefab with
      `Spawner.RegisterPrefab(id, prefab)` (it persists across reconnects).
- [ ] Is a second copy of the script already in the scene? Its `Update()` logs
      *"not owner"* forever while the spawned copy is fine. Log
      `GetInstanceID()`, `IsSpawned`, and `OwnerPlayerId` to tell them apart.
- [ ] Spawn from `OnRoomJoined` (or later): the local player id arrives with the
      room, so spawning before then leaves the object unowned.

---

## RPC issues

### Symptom: `RPC request: malformed payload, dropped` on the receiver

The gateway must preserve the `EnhancedRpc` wire flag when it fans an
`[RtmpeRpc]` call out to peers; a build that drops it delivers your enhanced
payload to the legacy parser, which reports *malformed*. This was a server-side
defect fixed on 2026-07-13 — no SDK or code change is needed on your side. If you
see it against a self-hosted gateway, update the gateway build.

### Symptom: `no [RtmpeRpc] method with id 0x… on <SomeType>` — the RPC is dropped

The call reached the object but the SDK looked for the method on the wrong
component. An object routes RPCs through its **anchor** (the **first**
`NetworkBehaviour` on the GameObject), and `<SomeType>` in the message is that
anchor. The named id is hashed from the *declaring* type, so this fires when the
`[RtmpeRpc]` method lives on a different component than the anchor.

- [ ] **On v1.9.6 or newer:** the SDK resolves the call to whichever component
      declares the method, so this should not occur — confirm the package is
      actually updated (`Packages/com.rtmpe.sdk/package.json` → `"version"`), and
      that the *receiver's* object carries a component of the same type that the
      sender declared the method on (both clients run the same prefab).
- [ ] **On an older package:** move the `[RtmpeRpc]` method onto the object's
      **first** `NetworkBehaviour`. For a global event (e.g. "start game"), the
      clean home is a dedicated networked manager object whose first
      `NetworkBehaviour` declares the RPC — not a per-player object whose first
      component is something else.
- [ ] Coming from Photon Fusion (RPCs on the specific `NetworkBehaviour`)? That
      pattern is supported as of v1.9.6; on older builds the anchor rule above
      applies. See [API → Remote Procedure Calls](api/index.md#remote-procedure-calls).

### Symptom: an `[RtmpeRpc]` call never runs, no "malformed"/"no method" log

- [ ] Is the method `public`, non-`static`, on a `NetworkBehaviour` subclass, with
      only supported parameter types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `byte[]`,
      `ulong`, `Vector3`, `Color`, `Quaternion`, or `INetworkSerializable`)? The
      shipped Roslyn analyzers flag violations at compile time.
- [ ] Does the wire audience match the declared one? A method declared
      `[RtmpeRpc(RpcTarget.Others)]` invoked as `All` (or vice-versa) is refused;
      declare the audience you actually send. A `RpcTarget.Server` method never
      runs on a client.
- [ ] Are you in a room? RPCs are dropped before `OnRoomJoined`.

---

## Performance symptoms

### Symptom: GC spikes every 1–2 seconds

Allocations in hot paths are the most common cause. Profile with
`Profiler.GetTotalAllocatedMemoryLong()` delta per tick.

- [ ] Are you caching the payload buffer from `OnDataReceived`? The SDK
      owns that buffer and reuses it — copy only the bytes you need.
- [ ] Are you spawning and despawning objects every frame? Install an
      [`INetworkObjectPool`](getting-started.md#step-12--object-pooling-optional)
      to eliminate `Instantiate` / `Destroy` allocations.
- [ ] Are you creating closures (anonymous lambdas) inside `Update`? Cache
      them as fields, as shown in the Getting Started guide.

**Expected GC budget (v1.1):** ≤ ~2 KiB / tick at 30 Hz with 10
`NetworkVariable` instances and no user-level allocations. See
[performance-tuning.md](performance-tuning.md) for details.

---

### Symptom: CPU spikes on reconnection

`NetworkManager.Reconnect()` uses the `ReconnectBackoff` (Full-Jitter capped
exponential) internally. Do not wrap `Reconnect()` in a `while` loop — it
takes care of retry cadence automatically.

---

## Unity-specific issues

### IL2CPP: `MissingMethodException` at runtime

Unity AOT code stripping removes members it cannot prove are reached from a
static call site. The SDK ships a `link.xml` that preserves its own runtime
assembly (`RTMPE.SDK.Runtime`), so the SDK's reflective RPC and variable paths
survive stripping with no action on your part.

Your game's `[RtmpeRpc]` methods and any custom `NetworkVariable<T>` closed
types live in your own assembly, which the SDK cannot preserve for you. When
the **Managed Stripping Level** is above **Low**, add a `link.xml` under your
project's `Assets/` folder that preserves them:

```xml
<linker>
    <assembly fullname="Assembly-CSharp">
        <type fullname="MyGame.PlayerController" preserve="all" />
        <type fullname="MyGame.MyCustomState" preserve="all" />
    </assembly>
</linker>
```

Replace `Assembly-CSharp` with your gameplay assembly name if you use an
`.asmdef`. The built-in `NetworkVariable<T>` closures for `int`, `float`,
`bool`, `Vector3`, `Quaternion`, and `string` are already preserved by the
SDK's own `link.xml`.

---

### IL2CPP: `ExecutionEngineException` on generic `NetworkVariable<T>`

The SDK pre-specialises generic paths for `int`, `float`, `bool`, `Vector3`,
`Quaternion`, and `string`. A custom `T` requires either:

- The `[Preserve]` attribute on the type definition, **or**
- A non-stripped code path that creates at least one `NetworkVariable<T>`
  instance, forcing AOT specialisation.

---

### WebGL: UDP is not available — use a custom transport

Unity WebGL runs in the browser sandbox, which has no access to raw UDP
sockets. Ship a WebGL build by:

1. Implementing a `WebSocketTransport : NetworkTransport` backed by
   `System.Net.WebSockets.ClientWebSocket` (desktop builds) or a
   `DllImport("__Internal")`-based JavaScript bridge (WebGL).
2. Installing it before `Connect()`:
   ```csharp
   NetworkManager.SetTransportFactory(settings => new WebSocketTransport(settings));
   ```
3. Deploying a WebSocket-to-UDP bridge in front of the RTMPE Gateway, or a
   dedicated WebSocket gateway build.

The default gateway image speaks UDP+KCP only — a WebSocket endpoint is not
part of the stock deployment. See
[Architecture §3 — Pluggable transport](architecture.md#3-transport-layer).

---

### Mobile: excessive battery drain

- Lower `NetworkManager.Settings.tickRate` from the default `30` to `10`–`15`
  for games that do not require sub-100 ms input latency.
- Handle `OnApplicationPause(true)` by calling `Disconnect()`. On resume,
  call `Reconnect()` — the stored reconnect token avoids a full re-auth.

---

### Scene transitions: stale registry entries

If you load a new scene with `SceneManager.LoadScene` without first calling
`SpawnManager.Despawn` on scene-specific networked objects, the registry
holds dead references until the next `ClearAll()` (room leave / disconnect).

v1.1 subscribes to `SceneManager.sceneUnloaded` / `sceneLoaded` and calls
`NetworkObjectRegistry.PruneDestroyed()` automatically to evict those dead
references. If you want server-side cleanup of those objects, despawn them
explicitly before loading the new scene:

```csharp
foreach (var obj in NetworkManager.Instance.Spawner.Registry.GetAll())
{
    if (obj.IsOwner)
        NetworkManager.Instance.Spawner.Despawn(obj.NetworkObjectId);
}
UnityEngine.SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene("NextLevel");
```

---

## Authoring-tool issues (Roslyn analyzer / conversion quick fixes)

### Symptom: RTMPE diagnostics appear, but the only quick fix offered is "Suppress / Configure"

**Check the rule id first.** Most RTMPE rules have no quick fix by design, and
on those *Suppress / Configure* is the complete and correct menu. Five rules
carry a lightbulb — `RTMPE1020`, `RTMPE2001`, `RTMPE2002`, `RTMPE2003`,
`RTMPE2004` — and none of the four Warning-severity rules is among them, so a
session spent on warnings never sees one. The
[Analyzer Rule Reference](diagnostics.md) lists every rule with its severity and
whether it is fixable, records the conditions under which a fixable rule still
withholds its fix, and gives a paste-ready one-file check on `RTMPE1020` —
Error severity, so it cannot be missed — that confirms the whole chain in
isolation. Work through it before treating this as a host problem: it explains
the symptom far more often than anything below does.

Everything that follows applies once you have confirmed the rule you are on is
one of the five.

The diagnostic surfacing at all proves `RTMPE.SDK.Analyzers.dll` loaded — the
analyzer half of the toolchain is working. The conversion quick fixes live in a
**second** assembly, `RTMPE.SDK.CodeFixes.dll`, and that one is what raises the
lightbulb. Both ship in `Packages/com.rtmpe.sdk/Analyzers/`, both carry the
`RoslynAnalyzer` asset label, and the package is complete when all four DLLs are
present:

```
Analyzers/RTMPE.SDK.Analyzers.dll         diagnostics  (RTMPE1xxx / RTMPE2xxx)
Analyzers/RTMPE.SDK.CodeFixes.dll         quick fixes  ← the lightbulb
Analyzers/RTMPE.SDK.Transforms.dll        shared edit core
Analyzers/RTMPE.SDK.Conversion.Core.dll   id/ledger engine
```

The asymmetry is by design, and it is what makes a host-side failure possible at
all: `CodeFixes` references
`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces`, the Roslyn **IDE** layer. The
analyzer does not. Unity's own `csc` has no Workspaces layer, so it loads
`Analyzers` and skips `CodeFixes` — that is expected, not an error, and any
"no analyzers in assembly" notice about `CodeFixes` in the Unity Console is
cosmetic. Supplying Workspaces is the IDE's job, so whether the lightbulb
appears depends entirely on the editor:

| Editor | Diagnostics | Conversion quick fixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JetBrains Rider | yes | yes |
| Visual Studio 2022 | yes | yes |
| VS Code + **C# Dev Kit** (Roslyn LSP) | yes | yes |
| VS Code + **OmniSharp** (legacy C# extension) | yes | **no** — this symptom |

If you are on VS Code and see only Suppress/Configure:

1. Install **C# Dev Kit** (`ms-dotnettools.csdevkit`) and make sure the legacy
   OmniSharp-only path is not in use — in Settings, `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp`
   must be **false** (the default). OmniSharp reports analyzer diagnostics but
   does not run `CodeFixProvider`s loaded from an `<Analyzer>` reference.
2. In Unity, use the **Visual Studio Editor** package
   (`com.unity.ide.visualstudio`) — it is what emits the `<Analyzer …/>` entries
   into the generated `.csproj`, for VS Code as well as Visual Studio. The old
   `com.unity.ide.vscode` package is deprecated and does not.
3. Regenerate the project files (**Edit → Preferences → External Tools →
   Regenerate project files**) and confirm the entries landed:

   ```bash
   grep -c "RTMPE.SDK.CodeFixes.dll" Assembly-CSharp.csproj   # expect 1
   ```

4. Reload the window (**Developer: Reload Window**) so the LSP re-reads the
   analyzer set.

### The conversion path that does not depend on any IDE

The quick fixes are a convenience layer. Every conversion they perform is
executed by the same `RTMPE.SDK.Transforms` core through the wizard, which runs
as an out-of-process CLI and needs no IDE support at all:

**Window → RTMPE → Conversion Wizard**

If the lightbulb cannot be made to appear in your editor, the wizard produces
byte-identical output — it is a fallback with no loss of capability, not a
degraded mode.

## Reporting bugs

If none of the above resolves the issue, open an issue at
<https://github.com/rtmpengine/unity-rtmpe-sdk-automation/issues> and include:

1. SDK version — found in `Packages/com.rtmpe.sdk/package.json`.
2. Unity version (e.g. `6000.1.0f1`) and scripting backend (Mono / IL2CPP).
3. Target platform (Windows / macOS / iOS / Android / WebGL).
4. The full `NetworkManager` log with `NetworkSettings.enableDebugLogs = true`.
5. A minimal reproduction project if possible.

*RTMPE SDK 2.0.11*
